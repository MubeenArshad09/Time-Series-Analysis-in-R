# Time-Series-Analysis-in-R
Forecasted long-term marriage trends in England using exponential smoothing and ARIMA models in R.

Time Series Forecasting of Marriage Trends in England

Using the "UK Vital Statistics" dataset, this task models and forecasts the annual marriage rate in England from 1850 to 2021.

### Key Methods:
- Time series decomposition
- Holt-Winters exponential smoothing
- ARIMA modeling using `auto.arima()`
- ACF, PACF, and Ljung-Box test diagnostics
- Forecast evaluation using residual analysis
